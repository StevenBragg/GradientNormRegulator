# GradientNormRegulator
The GradientNormRegulator is a Python class that implements a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to dynamically adjust the learning rate during neural network training. It aims to maintain a target gradient norm, which can help stabilize training and potentially improve model performance.
